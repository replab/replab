classdef FiniteGroupDecomposition < replab.Str
% Describes the decomposition of a "group" into a product of coset representatives
%
% Describes the set U = { u }, where u = u_1 u_2 ... u_n and
% u_i is in transversals{i}
%
% The set U possibly has repetitions of elements, and composition
% of elements is done according to the binary operation of "group".
%
% A construction comes from the decomposition of a group into
% a chain of subgroups
% G = G_1 >= G_2 >= ... G_{n+1} = <>
% where transversals{i} are (left) coset representatives of G_i / G_{i+1}
