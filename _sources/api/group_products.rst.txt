Group product constructions
===========================

Product constructions enable the user to construct new groups from the groups provided in RepLAB. The product constructions below also provide ways to construct standard representations that arise from representations of the factor groups.

.. module:: +replab

* `.DirectProductGroup` represents the (outer) direct product of compact groups, the elements are represented by row cell arrays.

* `.SemidirectProductGroup` represents an outer semidirect product arising from the action of a group on another.

* `.WreathProductGroup` describes the wreath product of a compact group by a permutation group.
