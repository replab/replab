**RepLAB** provides tools to study representations of finite groups and decompose them numerically. It is compatible with both MATLAB and Octave.


## A simple example

The construction of permutation groups and their representations can be achieved in a few lines of code, including the decomposition of their representations into irreducible representations. See the [**full explanation**](docs/publish/Example.html) ...

## How to start using RepLab

See the [**Installation guide**](docs/installation.html).

## Work in progress

**RepLAB** is a work-in-progress. In particular:

- Representations over the complex field are not supported, nor are monomial groups with complex roots of unity.
- RepLAB only works in double floating-point precision.
- When decomposing representations over the reals, irreducible representations of quaternionic type are detected but not yet decomposed.
- Representations are handled by decomposing preimages in words over generators, which limits the order of groups that can be handled.
- While RepLAB has a basic implementation of the BSGS construction, it does not offer much to work with permutation groups.

## Why RepLAB?

Because no open source library exists to decomposes arbitrary permutation/monomial representations into irreducible representations over the reals. RepLAB implements numerical methods that perform this decomposition up to machine precision.

That said, other libraries working on the same problem space include:

- The [GAP System 3 package AREP](https://www.gap-system.org/Gap3/Packages3/arep.html) by Sebastian Egner and Markus PÃ¼schel. 
- [NCSOStools](http://ncsostools.fis.unm.si/documentation/awbd) includes an implementation of the Murota-Kanno-Kojima-Kojima-Maehara algorithm to decompose matrix *-algebras.
