# API Documentation style guide

This document describes the syntax and best practices for the documentation comments embedded in the source code. 

## Overview

This document is heavily inspired by the [numpydoc docstring guide](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#docstring-standard) and follows its structure. 

We employ the variants proposed by the [Google style](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html) for compactness.

We aim to achieve the following middle ground:

- The documentation comments can be read on the MATLAB command line when the `help FUN` command is used, and it can be browsed through the `doc FUN` command.

- The documentation comments can be parsed with Sphinx to produce stylish and naviguable documentation.

## Documentation comments

MATLAB documentation calls the documentation strings that appears at the beginning of a class/function/method/property definition `comments`. To distinguish them from code comments, we call those special comments `documentation comments`, noting that the `docstring` terminology is specific to the Python language (standalone strings in the source code).

The documentation comments are written using a subset of the [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) syntax. This style guide does not list which syntax elements are permitted: use common sense to employ the conventions that are compatible with reStructuredText, and display well standalone on the terminal (as is advocated by the numpydoc guide linked above).

In particular, we use single backticks for class, function, method, property names, and double backticks for verbatim text.

> A guiding principle is that human readers of the text are given precedence over contorting docstrings so our tools produce nice output.

The length of comment lines should be kept to 75 characters; note that this applies to the comment string itself, not including the `%` character, whitespace, and source code tokens. RepLAB uses longer source code lines.

### First part of a documentation comment

For a class, function or method (uniquely referred to as function from now on), a documentation comment starts with the following introductory content:

1. First line with the short name of the function followed by a concise description. Names are not capitalized.

2. Second line empty

3. Third line presents a full call to the function with all arguments and outputs. The function name is qualified with full class structure. Optional arguments are surrounded by square brackets.

4. An extended description (and/or discussion) of the function follows the third line. This should clarify the role played by the function, i.e. its *functionality*, not to discuss implementation details or background theory, which should rather be explored in the **Notes** section below. You may refer to the parameters and the function name (using single backticks), but the parameter descriptions belong in the **Parameters** section.

Here is an example of these first few lines of documentation comment:

```matlab
function suite = fromMethod(testClass, testMethod, varargin)
% fromMethod - Create a suite from a single test method
%
% suite = matlab.unittest.TestSuite.fromMethod(testclass, testmethod, [varargin])
% creates a TestSuite from the test class described by testclass and the
% test method described by testmethod and returns it in suite. testclass
% is a meta.class instance which describes the desired test class. The
% ...
```

When the concise description is sufficiently clear to define the function, the complete description can be omitted. Here is an example:

```matlab
function z = plus(x, y)
% plus - Addition operation
%
% z = plus(x, y)
```

After these initial informations come the sections described below, providing further systematic details.

### Sections

The documentation comment can contain a number of sections separated by headings. Each heading is given by a keyword from the following list, with the section content indented.

We use the following section headings:

- `Args` as an alias to Sphinx `Parameters`

- `Returns` (for multiple return arguments, see the use of underlined section headers below).

- `Raises`

- `Example`

- `See Also`

- `Notes`

See also the [Napoleon](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/napoleon.html) documentation for other possible section headers.

In order, the sections of a function comment are:

1. Arguments/Parameters

   Description of the function arguments, keywords and their respective types, using Google style. Argument names are not capitalized.
   
   ```matlab
   % Args:
   %   x (type): Description of parameter `x`.
   %   y: Description of parameter `y` (with type not specified)
   ```

   If it is not necessary to specify an argument, use `optional`:

   ```matlab
   %   x (type, optional): optional parameter of type `type`
   ```

   When a parameter can only assume one of a fixed set of values, those values can be listed in braces. If the argument is optional, the default value appears first:

   ```matlab
   %   field ({'R', 'C'})
   ```

   When two or more input parameters have exactly the same type, shape and description, they can be combined:

   ```matlab
   %   a, b (double): Elements to sum
   ```

   Matlab/Octave encodes integer values using double floating point numbers. Our convention is to name those values `integer`. In the rare case a primitive integer type is needed, we write that type precisely (as in `int32` or `uint32`). Big integers have type `vpi`, which is the name of the external library that supports them.

   Permutations are stored using row double vectors containing integers, and are documented as `permutation`. Same convention for signed permutations, that are documented as `signed permutation`.

   Strings represented as char arrays have type `char` (recent Matlab versions have a new `string` type which should not be confused with).

   Function handles have type `function_handle`.

2. Returns

    Explanation of the returned values and their types. Return values are not capitalized. We distinguish two cases.
   
    First, when a single value is returned, we use the Google style:
   
   ```matlab
   function c = sum(a, b)
   % sum - Sums two numbers
   %
   % c = sum(a, b)
   % Adds the value of a and b.
   %
   % Returns:
   %   double: The sum of the parameters
   ```

   ```matlab
   function [c d] = sorted2(a, b)
   % sorted2 - Sorts two numbers
   %
   % [c d] = sorted2(a, b)
   % Returns a and b as c and d so as to always satisfy the condition c <= d.
   %
   % Returns
   % -------
   %   c: double
   %     Smallest number
   %   d: double
   %     Largest number
   ```

3. Raises (optional)

   An optional section detailling which errors get raised and under what conditions.
	
   TO BE COMPLETED
	
4. Warnings (optional)

   An optional section detailling which warnings get raised and under what conditions, formatted similarly to Raises.

5. Examples (encouraged)

   A section with explicit commands illustrating as clearly as possible one or several ways of calling the function.

   (TODO: allow examples that would be executed by the test framework, possibly with doctests, to be tested)
	
6. See Also (encouraged)

   An optional section used to refer to related code. This will allow for easily browsing the documentation. Fully qualified names should be used for class objects and methods.
	
7. Notes (optional)

   This optional section can provide various additional information about the code of interest to the user, such as a discussion about the algorithm used by the function. Depreciation warnings can also be specified here. We haven't yet specified a formal syntax for those. The numpydoc convention uses a Sphinx directive which we tend to avoid.

   Before the section, the comment should be broken by a single empty line without `%`. This should stop matlab from parsing, and thus allow us to use further formatting such as LaTeX. The content from now on would then only be presented in the Sphinx API. (TODO: check this)

   (TODO: should we allow the use of LaTeX equations with `$` delimitations there, as in the numpydoc guide stipulates?)
   (Is there a way to filter out this section when the `help` function is called from the REPL?)


8. References (optional)

    (TODO: should we allow references for the **Notes** section here? see numpydoc guide)


## Documenting functions

The documentation comment is given right after the `function` declaration.

## Documenting classes

We document classes immediately after the `classdef` declaration. However, this class document does not address class properties or constructor parameters.

Class properties are documented by *not* adding a semicolon `;` to each property, and following them by a comment as in below:

```matlab
properties (SetAccess = protected)
    group % Group being representation
    field % 'R' for a representation on a real vector space, 'C' for a representation on a complex vector space
    dimension % Representation dimension
end
```

Methods are documented as are standalone functions. Do not include `self` in the list of parameters. The constructor is documented separately as any method.

Abstract methods should have a single code line in their body `error('Abstract');`.

## Other points

- Equations: we do not use currently LaTeX formatting. (TODO: should we, in the future?)

- We use sparingly the reST conventions for italics, bold and monospace, but not for variable names. Variable, package, method, function and class names should be written between single back-ticks.
