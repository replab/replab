This allows imposing the positivity of the matrix through the positivity of small blocks. As an example, consider the following matrix</p><pre class="codeinput">MInvariant = [x 1 y
              y x 1
              1 y x];

</pre><h2>Comparison with a direct formulation<a name="23"></a></h2><p>To conclude, let us show in more detail why the SDP formulation of a problem is more efficient if it takes advantage of the available symmetry properties. For this, we consider again the problem described at the beginning of this page. This problem can be solved directly as follows:</p><pre class="codeinput">M = sdpvar(3);
constraints = [trace(M) == 1, M(permutation, permutation) == M, M &gt;= 0];
diagnostic = optimize(constraints, M(1,2), sdpsettings(<span class="string">'verbose'</span>, 0))

%% Symmetric SDPs
%
% This document illustrated how *RepLAB* can be used to solve Semidefinite
% Programs (SDP) subject to symmetries.


%% Preparation
% As always, before using *RepLAB* commands, first add the paths:
replab_init
%%
% Commands in this document makes use ot the YALMIP interface to solve
% convex optimization problems, see
% <../installation.html installation instructions>.


%% Introduction
% <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semidefinite_programming Semidefinite
% Programming> is a form of optimization that admits semidefinite
% constraints (as in the condition that all eigenvalues of a matrix must be
% positive). It naturally arises in various fields, including operational
% research and polynomial optimization. 
% 
% The ability to solve a semidefinite program depends heavily on:
%
% * the size of the positive semi-definite (PSD) blocks
% * the number of variables and constraints involved
%
% A positive semi-definite matrix that is invariant under some joint
% permutation of its lines and columns can be decomposed into a block
% diagonal form. This allows to:
%
% * decompose PSD blocks into smaller PSD blocks
% * set many variables to zero, hence reducing the number of variables in
% the problem
%
% As we shows below, *RepLAB* performs this simplification automatically.


%% Formulating a symmetric SDP
% To illustrate the usage of *RepLAB* for symmetric SDPs, we consider a
% simple example involving a 3x3 matrix $M$ with trace 1 that is symmetric
% under cyclic permutation of its indices, i.e. it satisfies $M([2\ 3\ 1], [2\ 3\ 1]) = M$.
% We ask what is the smallest value that the off-diagonal element
% $M(1,2)$ can take if this matrix $M$ has only positive eigenvalues.

%%
% <html>
% <h3>Symmetric formulation</h3>
% </html>
%%
% Using *RepLAB*, we can solve this problem as follows.
%
% We start by defining a matrix which satisfies the desired symmetry
permutation = [2 3 1];
MSym = replab.CommutantVar.fromPermutations({permutation}, 'symmetric', 'real');
%%
% We can then perform the optimization with:
constraintsSym = [trace(MSym) == 1, MSym >= 0];
diagnosticSym = optimize(constraintsSym, MSym(1,2), sdpsettings('verbose', 0));
MSymOpt = value(MSym)
%%
% We find the critical value of $-1/6$.
%
% At the end of this page, we discuss how this formulation is more
% efficient than a direct formulation which would not take advantage of the
% symmetry properties of the considered matrix.


%% Constructing a symmetric SDP matrix with additional structure
% An SDP matrix might sometimes be subject to more than only symmetry
% constraints. When these additional constraints take the form of equality
% between some of the matrix elements, it can be conveniently described by
% a matrix having at each element the index of the corresponding variable.
% All elements with identical index are then understood as being equal to
% each other.
%%
% For instance, imposing on a 3x3 matrix that elements (1,1) ans (2,1) are
% must be equal to each other can be described by the following index
% matrix:
indexMatrix = [1 2 3
               1 4 5
               6 7 8];
%%
% An SDP matrix satisfying this constraint is then obtained
cstrSdpMatrix = replab.CommutantVar.fromIndexMatrix(indexMatrix, {permutation}, 'symmetric', 'real')
%%
% In this trivial case, the SDP matrix is left to contain only one
% variable: the additional constraints collapsed the all group orbits
% together.


%% Imposing symmetry to an existing SDP matrix
% Symmetry constraints can also be straightforwardly imposed on existing
% SDP matrices with arbitrary structure.
%%
% For instance, consider the following special SDP matrix
x = sdpvar;
y = sdpvar
MSpecial = [1 x y
            x 1 y
            x y 1];
%%
% We can directly impose cyclic symmetry onto this matrix:
MSpecialSym = replab.CommutantVar.fromSdpMatrix(MSpecial, {[2 3 1]})
%%
% Requesting this matrix to be PSD now imposes both
%
% * Positivity of the 1x1 and 2x2 blocks
% * Equality with the imposed form
%
% as can be seen with
MSpecialSym >= 0


%% Block-diagonalizing a symmetric SDP matrix
% When an SDP matrix is invariant under the considered permutations,
% *RepLAB* can be used to block-diagonalize it. This allows imposing the
% positivity of the matrix through the positivity of small blocks. As an
% example, consider the following matrix
MInvariant = [x 1 y
              y x 1
              1 y x];
%%
% It is indeed invariant:
MInvariant - MInvariant(permutation,permutation)
%%
% But not transpose-invariant (which is necessay for PSD matrices), so we
% enforce it:
MInvariant = MInvariant + MInvariant';
MInvariant - MInvariant'
%%
% We can now block-diagonalize it by calling
MInvariantBlock = replab.CommutantVar.fromSymSdpMatrix(MInvariant, {[2 3 1]})
%%
% No new variable has been introduced in the new object, but the block
% structure has been found:
full(MInvariantBlock.blockMask)
%%
% The block structure is used when requesting this matrix to be PSD:
MInvariantBlock >= 0


%% Comparison with a direct formulation
%
% To conclude, let us show in more detail why the SDP formulation of a
% problem is more efficient if it takes advantage of the available symmetry
% properties. For this, we consider again the problem described at the
% beginning of this page. This problem can be solved directly as follows:
M = sdpvar(3);
constraints = [trace(M) == 1, M(permutation, permutation) == M, M >= 0];
diagnostic = optimize(constraints, M(1,2), sdpsettings('verbose', 0))
MOpt = value(M)
%%
% Again, we find that the lowest possible value of $M(1,2)$ which is
% compatible with the matrix $M$ having only positive eigenvalues is
% $-1/6$. However, this last SDP problem is more complex than the first one
% which takes into account symmetries.

% The symmetric formulation of the above problem involves fewer variables
% and simpler constraints, as summarized in the following table:
%

% <table align="center">
%  <tr>
%    <th>formulation</th>
%    <th>direct</th>
%    <th>symmetric</th>
%  </tr>
%  <tr>
%    <td># variables</td>
%    <td>6</td>
%    <td>2</td>
%  </tr>
%  <tr>
%    <td># equality constraints</td>
%    <td>10</td>
%    <td>1</td>

%  <tr>
%    <td>size of PSD blocks</td>
%    <td>3</td>
%    <td>1 and 2</td>
%  </tr>
% </table>

%%
% This can be checked by examining the variables involved. In the non-symmetrized
% case, we have
M
%%
constraints
%%
% we see that it involves
%
% * 6 variables
% * 1+3x3=10 equality constraints
% * 1 PSD block of size 3x3
%
%%
% In the symmetrized case, we have
MSym
%%
% In other words, the matrix is made of two blocks of size 1x1 and 2x2, and
% involves altogether just 2 variables.
%%
% The constraints this time are
constraintsSym
%%
% This formulation thus involves :
%
% * 2 variables
% * 1 equality constraint
% * SDP blocks of size 1x1 and 2x2
