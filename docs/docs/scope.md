# Scope of the RepLAB project

This document describes the intended extent of the **RepLAB** project, both in terms of desired support and limitations, whether temporary or longer term.

## Extent of the library

The **RepLAB** aims . It should:

 - Manage groups, including:
     - Group construction from permutations
 - Manage representations, including:
     - Irreducible decomposition
 - Provide tools to deal with semi-definite programs subject to symmetry constraints

 
## Limitations to the library

Every implementation has limitations. Currently, the following elements are out of the scope of the library

### Current limitations

 - No support for group intersection
 - No support for coset calculation

### Limitations with no plan of being addressed

 - Construction of groups from matrix images
