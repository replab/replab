    "For example, we can compute the basis for the 1D-eigenspace that corresponds to the __ground state__, that is the eigenstate with the lowest eigenvalue. According to the diagonal matrix $E_1$, the lowest eigenvalue is $\\lambda_{GS} = 1.1716$ and the respective eigenvector can be read from the corresponding column of the matrix $U_1$. Moreover, if we let $x_1, x_2$ and $x_3$ be the symmetry adapted basis of the first isotypic component, then the basis vector of the eigenspace $E_{GS}$ will be given as a linear combination of the form $ax_1 + bx_2 + cx_3$, where the coefficients $a,b,c$ correspond to the non-zero elements of the third column of $U_1$.\n",

    "The important thing to notice here is that in the **ground oscillation** the displacements of each of the lattice points have the same sign, thus recovering the result from the *theory of continuous oscillators* that the ground oscillation never vanishes in the interior of the membrane. On the other hand, as fas as the **oscillation with the highest frequency** is concerned, the displacements have a maximal number of sign changes. To clarify this, we have included in the plot the plane $z=0$, so that we can verify that between two positive displacements there is a negative one (this can be seen from the lattice function ``HS_matrix`` as well), leading to a maximum number of node lines in the membrane region. We refer the reader to the classical [texbook](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9783527617210) of Courant and Hilbert for a complete treatment of vibrations and eigenvalue problems."

    "In this tutorial, we have illustrated how group theoretical methods can be implemented in an eigenvalue problem when the operator in question is subject to symmetries and we indicated a way that *RepLAB* can act as a complement to numerically solve a toy model, namely the eigenvalue problem of an oscillating square membrane. In particular, we emphasized that we can arrive at the **block diagonalization** of the matrix $M$ with ease, provided that we make use of a unique feature of *RepLAB*: the change of basis matrix that it provides, every time we ask *RepLAB* to decompose a representation into its irreducible components.\n",

    "Before we close, even though we discretized the square region using only $n=9$ lattice points, thus asking for the dihedral group $D_4$ as a subgroup in the group $S_9$, a generalization of the method presented in this document is straighforward in arbitrary number of points. For instance, we could have employed a lattice with even more points and asking for $D_4$ as a subgroup in the symmetric group $S_n$. However, for the purposes of the current tutorial, we decided to use only 9 lattice points and focus on making clear how a block-diagonal structure for the matrix $M$ can be accomplished numerically in *RepLAB*."
