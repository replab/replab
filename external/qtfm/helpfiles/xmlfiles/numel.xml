        <code>numel(X)</code> returns the number of quaternions or octonions in an
        array, just as the corresponding built-in &matlab; function does for other types.

    <para>
        There is a complex history to this function, which is relevant only to code
        developed with versions of QTFM prior to 2.4 and versions of &matlab; prior
        to R2015b, when a new function <code>numArgumentsFromSubscript</code>
        was introduced into &matlab;. See the notes in the quaternion (not
        octonion) source file for
        information about this.
