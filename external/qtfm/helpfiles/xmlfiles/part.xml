<short>Component of a quaternion or octonion</short>
<syntax>p = part(q, n)</syntax>
<long>
<para>
This function extracts one of the four components of a quaternion or one of
the eight components of an octonion. The result is a real
(or a complex value if the quaternion/octonion has complex components).
The parameter must be an integer in the range 1:4 or 1:8 as appropriate.
For quaternions, there are also three named functions <code>x</code>,
<code>y</code>, and <code>z</code> that can also access the components of
the vector part. These are not provided for octonions, as the present
function seemed a better implementation, since it is possible to index
through the components. The scalar part can also be accessed through the
<code>s</code> and <code>scalar</code> functions, which differ in their
behaviour if the quaternion/octonion is pure. The present function behaves
like <code>s</code> and returns an empty array for a pure quaternion or
octonion.

q = 1 + 2 * I + 3 * J + 4 * K
