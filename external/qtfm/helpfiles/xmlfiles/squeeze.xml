<code>squeeze(X)</code> removes singleton dimensions from a quaternion array.
It is a straightforward overloading of the &matlab; function of the same name
implemented by a common mechanism for quaternion functions that can be
computed by separate application of the &matlab; function to each component
of the quaternion array. In the octonion case, this has not been done, but the
function works because the &matlab; function works by calling the overloaded
reshape. A future cleanup may delete the quaternion overload and rely on the
&matlab; function, but test code would need to be added, which makes it a
non-trivial fix.
