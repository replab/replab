<short>Angle of a quaternion in polar form</short>
<syntax>θ = angle(q, a)</syntax>
<long>
<para>
<code>angle(X)</code> computes the angle of a quaternion in polar form. The
polar form of a quaternion is q = A exp(μθ) where A is a real or complex
modulus, μ is a unit pure quaternion, and θ is an angle. It is θ that is
computed by this function.
</para>
<para>
The second parameter is optional. If omitted, the result will always be
in the range (0, π), that is, the quaternion q is regarded as being in
the upper half of a complex plane defined by the axis of q. A reference
unit vector defining the direction of the positive imaginary axis of q
may be supplied as the second parameter, in which case the result may
be in the full range from -π to +π. This reference unit vector is used
to define the north pole of a hemisphere of 3-space, so that if the axis
of q lies in this hemisphere, the angle is in the range (0,π). If the
axis of q lies in the other (southern) hemisphere, then the angle
returned will lie in (π, 2*π).
</para>
<para>
The optional argument must be either the same size as q or be a scalar
(in which case the same value is used for all elements of q).
