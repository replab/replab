<para>
<code>A/B</code> computes matrix right divide. It is implemented for
quaternion and octonion arrays only for the case where <code>B</code> is a scalar
(that is a single quaternion/octonion or numeric value). In this case, the
result is exactly the same as that given by the elementwise right
divide (<code>./</code>). The reason for implementing this
function is that some &matlab; code uses <code>/</code> when <code>./</code>
should have been used. The existence of this function in the &qtfm;
toolbox makes it possible for &matlab; functions to work on quaternion/octonion
arrays if all other necessary functions are overloaded. An example is the &matlab;
<code>cov</code> function.
