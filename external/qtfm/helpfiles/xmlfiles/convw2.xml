        <code>convw2(A, B)</code> computes the two-dimensional convolution of matrices
        <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> with wrap around. Unlike the standard
        convolution implemented by the <code>conv2</code> function, the result from
        this function matches that which would be obtained by a Fourier domain
        product, that is it treats the input as if extended periodically.

Acceptable calling profiles are:
<precode>
C = convw2(A, B)      - A is convolved on the left of B, that is A * B
C = convw2({L, R}, B) - The convolution is L * B * R. L and R must be of
                        the same size.
