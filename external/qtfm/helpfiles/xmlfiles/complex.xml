<short>Construct a complex quaternion/octonion from real quaternions/octonions.</short>
<syntax>q = complex(a,b)</syntax>
<long>
<para>
<code>complex</code> takes two quaternion arguments and constructs a
complexified quaternion with the first quaternion as real part, and the
second as the imaginary part. The result is equivalent to
<code>a + i * b</code> (where <code>i</code> is the standard &matlab;
complex operator). (Similarly for octonions.)
</para>
<para>
Once constructed, a complexified quaternion can be separated into four
complex components, or two quaternions (real and imaginary). It is of
course also possible to construct complexified quaternions by other
means, from four complex components.
</para>
<para>
The two arguments must be of the same size, unless one is scalar. If this
is the case the scalar argument is promoted in size to match the non-scalar
argument. (This behaviour matches the way the corresponding &matlab;
function operates.)

q = (1+5i) + (2+6i) * I + (3+7i) * J + (4+8i) * K
