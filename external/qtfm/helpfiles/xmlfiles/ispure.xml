<short>Test for pure quaternion</short>
<syntax>Y = ispure(X)</syntax>
<long>
<para>
<code>ispure(X)</code> returns logical 1 (<code>true</code>) if the
quaternion array <code>X</code> is <italic>pure</italic>.

<para>
Mathematically, a pure quaternion has zero scalar part. Here, pure
quaternions are <italic>stored</italic> without a scalar part, and it is
the existence of the
scalar part which is tested by this function, not its value. Thus a quaternion
with a scalar part with value zero is not pure according to the definition
used by this function. Similarly, empty quaternions do not have a scalar
part (or any part) and therefore this function regards them as pure.
</para>
<para>
The reason for implementing pure quaternions in the way described is for
efficiency: reduced storage, and reduced computation, since computation
with pure quaternions can be done without wasting time computing with the
zero scalar part.
