<h1>Quaternion Toolbox</h1>
<p>
The quaternion toolbox for Matlab&reg; (QTFM for short) extends
Matlab&reg; to handle vectors and matrices of quaternions.
Many quaternion-specific functions are implemented, as are overloadings of
standard Matlab&reg; functions and Matlab&reg; operators and notation.
The toolbox is intended to work as far as possible in the same way as Matlab&reg; itself.
Most functions are vectorized, and where a Matlab&reg; function is overloaded
by the toolbox, as far as possible the quaternion function accepts the same
parameters as the Matlab&reg; function.
</p>
<p>
From Version 2.0 of the toolbox onwards, octonions are also supported, in a
similar manner, but with fewer functions (this may change over time as more
functionality is added).
</p>
<p>
For a general overview of quaternions and octonions,
and how they are handled by the
toolbox, see the <a href="overview.html">overview</a> page.
For a detailed list of functions, see the
<a href="alphabetical.html">alphabetical</a> or
<a href="categorical.html">categorized</a> lists.
</p>
<p>
Many Matlab&reg; functions will work with quaternion arrays, because all
the functions called are overloaded by the toolbox, and the semantics of
the quaternion version are consistent with what the Matlab&reg; function
expects. A <a href="matlist.html">list of these functions</a> is available.
</p>
<h2>Website</h2>
<p>
The toolbox website and Sourceforge project page may be acccessed from the
Matlab&reg; Start menu, or from the following links:<br>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;<a href="http://qtfm.sourceforge.net/">Web site at Sourceforge</a>
<li>&nbsp;<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/qtfm/">Sourceforge project page</a>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Matlab&reg; version required</h2>
<p>
Matlab&reg; Version 7.14 (R2012a) is the minimum required system to run
version 2 of the toolbox.
Earlier versions of the toolbox will work with Version 7.4 (R2007a).
The test code (see below) verifies the version required and documents
the reasons for requiring it.
</p>
<h2>GNU Octave compatibility (under development)</h2>
<p>
From version 1.8 onwards, we have introduced some minor changes to attempt
to achieve compatibility with
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/">GNU Octave</a>.
At present, the toolbox will not work correctly under GNU Octave.
The test code (see below) will recognise that QTFM is running under Octave,
but the tests will fail due to serious problems with the GNU Octave search
path, and the lack of recognition by GNU Octave of the toolbox directory
structure. We welcome contributions to fixing these problems, which will be
acknowledged on the <a href="contrib.html">contributors page</a>.
</p>
<h2>Test code</h2>
<p>
Some test code is provided in the directory <tt>test</tt>.
To run it type <tt>qtfm_test</tt> in the command window.
This runs all the test code. There may be some warnings
about numerical accuracy of results, which vary from one test run to
the next, and can usually be ignored.
</p>
<h2>SVN Repository</h2>
<p>
    We use SVN for version control of files within the toolbox. Until November
    2017, we used CVS. The CVS repository was converted to SVN and therefore
    preserves most of the history of commits to the CVS repository. The CVS
    repository remains in existence for the time being, frozen at the state it
    was in at the end of November 2017.
</p>
<p>
New versions
of files are uploaded to the SVN repository at Sourceforge as we develop
them, in between releases of the toolbox. If you wish, you should be able
to set up your own SVN system to provide read-only access to the repository
and thus keep the toolbox updated in between releases. The effort of doing
this is not likely to be worthwhile unless you already know how to use SVN.
</p>
<p>
However, it may sometimes be worthwhile to check for a newer version of a
specific file, if you hit a problem. You can do this through a web interface
to the SVN repository:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/qtfm/svncode/HEAD/tree/">Browse SVN repository</a>
at Sourceforge.
</ul>

A list of people who have contributed to QTFM is available on a

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
<ul>
<li>
The online help documentation for this toolbox was improved as part of a project to
create initial documentation for the <a href = "http://clifford-multivector-toolbox.sourceforge.net/">Clifford Toolbox for Matlab</a>.
These improvements were done by Ryan Stuart, working as a Frontrunner placement student
on placement number FR1516207 funded by the University of Essex from June to August 2016.
The improvements were in the styling and presentation of the main help pages, and the
styling of the individual function pages.
