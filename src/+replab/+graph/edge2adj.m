% adjacency matrix of the graph

% Returns the adjacency matrix for a graph described by a list

%     edges (integer (\*,2)): array of vertices linked by an edge
%     n (integer): number of vertices
%     weights (double (\*,1), optional): weight associated to each edge
%
% Returns:
%     adj: adjacency matrix of the graph
