    "We illustrate the examples of states invariant under $U(2)$. At the time of writing this tutorial, RepLAB did support compact groups, only finite groups; as of March 2020, the support of continuous groups is still experimental. Thus, we use the Clifford group as an approximation of $U(2)$. The approximation stays valid for tensor products of up to three copies of the basic representation, as the Clifford group is a 3-design for $U(2)$.\n",
