As an open-source project, **RepLAB** relies on a community of users to
keep get better and develop in relevant directions. The project is
generously hosted on `GitHub <https://www.github.com/replab/replab>`_.
The easiest way to contribute is by sharing a suggestion or reporting an
issue `directly online <https://www.github.com/replab/replab/issues/new>`_.
Anyone with a github account can do that (an account can be easily created).
Every contribution is valued.
