Code organization and release process
=====================================

Directories
-----------

-  ``atlas``: atlas entries with character tables

-  ``docs``: compiled documentation ready for a web browser

-  ``external``: external libraries, either included as a Git submodule
   (if available on a public repository such as Github), or vendored
   (like ``vpi``). Here is the procedure to update a git submodule named ``project``:

    1. Enter the submodule directory with `cd external/project`
    2. Pull the latest version of the project with `git pull origin master`
    3. Go back to the `external` folder with `cd ..` and update the commit number in the file `submodules.ini` so that it matches the new status of the submodule (this is needed for the autoinstall feature).
    4. Commit these changes in the main RepLAB repository: `git add project submodules.ini`, `git commit -m "submodule project updated"`

-  ``generated``: files auto-generated by `~root.replab_generate`
   and `~root.replab_spinx`

-  ``sphinx``: source files for the executable documentation

-  ``src/+replab``: the main RepLAB package, containing the main
   classes/methods

-  ``src/+replab/+subpackages``: implementation files for different
   submodules, or experimental stuff

-  ``tests``: tests written using MOxUnit, augmented with our laws test
   framework, doctests and notebooks. Tests in this folder can be
   launched with `~root.replab_runtests`. Dedicated
   `Github actions <https://github.com/replab/replab/actions>`_ launch
   test suites on new commits and pull requests.

The release process
-------------------

RepLAB has a ``major.minor.patch`` version number.

The ``develop`` branch contains a snapshot, i.e. a version number that ends in ``-SNAP``.

The ``master`` branch contains a release, i.e. a version number that does not end in ``-SNAP``.

The ``gh-pages`` contains the documentation pages.

See `~root.replab_release` for a description of the release process.

Website release process
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The online documentation is generated by the `~root.replab_sphinx` function with the ``doublePass`` option. This creates a full copy of the website in the ``docs`` folder. For more details on how to set up a local Sphinx workflow, see :doc:`Sphinx tips and tricks <development/sphinx>`.

The release of the RepLAB `main website <https://replab.github.io/replab>`_ is automatized and can be triggered with a `dedicated Github action <https://github.com/replab/replab/actions/workflows/sphinx.yml>`_. An `annex repository <https://github.com/replab/websiteDev>`_ allows to test a new website online without affecting the current one.
