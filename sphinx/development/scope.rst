Scope of the RepLAB project
===========================

This document describes the intended extent of the **RepLAB** project,
both in terms of desired support and limitations, whether temporary or
longer term.

Extent of the library
---------------------

The first aim of **RepLAB** is to:

-  Manage groups, including:

   -  Group construction from permutations

-  Manage representations, including:

   -  Irreducible decomposition

-  Provide tools to deal with semi-definite programs subject to symmetry
   constraints

Limitations to the library
--------------------------

Every implementation has limitations. Currently, the following elements
are out of the scope of the library

Current limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  No support for group intersection
-  No support for coset calculation

Limitations with no plan of being addressed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Construction of groups from matrix images
