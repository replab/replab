% SDPs subject to symmetries are presented.

% ## Introduction
%
% [Semidefinite programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semidefinite_programming)
% is a form of optimization that admits semidefinite
% constraints (as in the condition that all eigenvalues of a matrix must be
% positive). It naturally arises in various fields, including operational
% research and polynomial optimization. 
%
% The ability to solve a semidefinite program depends heavily on:
%
% * the size of the positive semi-definite (PSD) blocks
% * the number of variables and constraints involved
%
% A positive semi-definite matrix that is invariant under some joint
% permutation of its lines and columns can be decomposed into a block
% diagonal form. This allows to:
%
% * decompose PSD blocks into smaller PSD blocks
% * set many variables to zero, hence reducing the number of variables in the problem
%
% As we shows below, *RepLAB* performs this simplification automatically.
%
% ## Formulating a symmetric SDP
%
% To illustrate the usage of *RepLAB* for symmetric SDPs, we consider a
% simple example involving a 3x3 matrix $M$ with trace 1 that is symmetric
% under cyclic permutation of its indices, i.e. it satisfies $M([2\ 3\ 1], [2\ 3\ 1]) = M$.
% We ask what is the smallest value that the off-diagonal element
% $M(1,2)$ can take if this matrix $M$ has only positive eigenvalues.

% ### Symmetric formulation
%
% Using *RepLAB*, we can solve this problem as follows.
%
% We start by defining a matrix which satisfies the desired symmetry

permutation = [2 3 1];
MSym = replab.CommutantVar.fromPermutations({permutation}, 'symmetric', 'real');

% We can then perform the optimization with:

constraintsSym = [trace(MSym) == 1, MSym >= 0];
diagnosticSym = optimize(constraintsSym, MSym(1,2), sdpsettings('verbose', 0));
MSymOpt = value(MSym)

% We find the critical value of $-1/6$.
%
% At the end of this page, we discuss how this formulation is more
% efficient than a direct formulation which would not take advantage of the
% symmetry properties of the considered matrix.

% ## Constructing a symmetric SDP matrix with additional structure
%
% An SDP matrix might sometimes be subject to more than only symmetry
% constraints. When these additional constraints take the form of equality
% between some of the matrix elements, it can be conveniently described by
% a matrix having at each element the index of the corresponding variable.
% All elements with identical index are then understood as being equal to
% each other.
%
% For instance, imposing on a 3x3 matrix that elements (1,1) ans (2,1) are
% must be equal to each other can be described by the following index
% matrix:

indexMatrix = [1 2 3
               1 4 5
               6 7 8];

% An SDP matrix satisfying this constraint is then obtained

cstrSdpMatrix = replab.CommutantVar.fromIndexMatrix(indexMatrix, {permutation}, 'symmetric', 'real')

% In this trivial case, the SDP matrix is left to contain only one variable: the additional constraints collapsed the all group orbits
% together.


% ## Imposing symmetry to an existing SDP matrix
%
% Symmetry constraints can also be straightforwardly imposed on existing SDP matrices with arbitrary structure.
%
% For instance, consider the following special SDP matrix

x = sdpvar;
y = sdpvar
MSpecial = [1 x y
            x 1 y
            x y 1];

% We can directly impose cyclic symmetry onto this matrix:

MSpecialSym = replab.CommutantVar.fromSdpMatrix(MSpecial, {[2 3 1]})

% Requesting this matrix to be PSD now imposes both
%
% * Positivity of the 1x1 and 2x2 blocks
% * Equality with the imposed form
%
% as can be seen with

MSpecialSym >= 0

% ## Block-diagonalizing a symmetric SDP matrix
%
% When an SDP matrix is invariant under the considered permutations,
% *RepLAB* can be used to block-diagonalize it. This allows imposing the
% positivity of the matrix through the positivity of small blocks. As an
% example, consider the following matrix

MInvariant = [x 1 y
              y x 1
              1 y x];

% It is indeed invariant:

MInvariant - MInvariant(permutation,permutation)

% But not transpose-invariant (which is necessary for PSD matrices), so we enforce it:

MInvariant = MInvariant + MInvariant';
MInvariant - MInvariant'

% We can now block-diagonalize it by calling

MInvariantBlock = replab.CommutantVar.fromSymSdpMatrix(MInvariant, {[2 3 1]})

% No new variable has been introduced in the new object, but the block structure has been found:

full(MInvariantBlock.blockMask)

% The block structure is used when requesting this matrix to be PSD:

MInvariantBlock >= 0

% ## Comparison with a direct formulation
%
% To conclude, let us show in more detail why the SDP formulation of a
% problem is more efficient if it takes advantage of the available symmetry
% properties. For this, we consider again the problem described at the
% beginning of this page. This problem can be solved directly as follows:

M = sdpvar(3);
constraints = [trace(M) == 1, M(permutation, permutation) == M, M >= 0];
diagnostic = optimize(constraints, M(1,2), sdpsettings('verbose', 0))
MOpt = value(M)

% Again, we find that the lowest possible value of $M(1,2)$ which is
% compatible with the matrix $M$ having only positive eigenvalues is
% $-1/6$. However, this last SDP problem is more complex than the first one
% which takes into account symmetries.

% ### Complexity comparison
%
% The symmetric formulation of the above problem involves fewer variables
% and simpler constraints, as summarized in the following table:
%
% | Formulation:           | Direct | Symmetric   |
% |------------------------|--------|-------------|
% | # variables            | 6      | 2           |
% | # equality constraints | 10     | 1           |
% | Size of PSD blocks     | 3      | 1x1 and 2x2 |

% This can be checked by examining the variables involved. In the non-symmetrized case, we have

M

constraints

% we see that it involves
%
% * 6 variables
% * 1+3x3=10 equality constraints
% * 1 PSD block of size 3x3
%
% In the symmetrized case, we have

MSym

% In other words, the matrix is made of two blocks of size 1x1 and 2x2, and
% involves altogether just 2 variables.

% The constraints this time are

constraintsSym

% This formulation thus involves:
%
% * 2 variables
% * 1 equality constraint
% * SDP blocks of size 1x1 and 2x2
