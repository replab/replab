Topic guides
============

This section explains and analyses some key concepts that appear in
**RepLAB**. The aim of the guides given here is not to show how to do
something specific with the library, but rather to explain some notions
at the heart of **RepLAB** and how the library works.

Scientific articles:

- `"RepLAB: a computational/numerical approach to representation theory" <https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09154>`_
  presents a concise overview of the approach used by **RepLAB**
- An introduction to representation theory: `Linear Representations of Finite Groups <https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4684-9458-7>`_ by Jean-Pierre Serre
