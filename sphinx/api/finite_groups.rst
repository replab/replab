Finite group structures
=======================

.. module:: +replab

Elements of finite groups all have a type described by a `.FiniteGroupType`.
For example, permutations acting on a certain domain, matrices of a given dimension; direct products of those.

* `.FiniteGroupType` : A group of elements from which finite subgroups can be constructed.
* `.FiniteGroup`: A group with a finite number of elements, is generated by a finite number of generators.
