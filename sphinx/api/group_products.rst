.. module:: +replab

- `+replab.DirectProductGroup`: represents the (outer) direct product of compact groups, the elements are represented by row cell arrays,

- `+replab.SemidirectProductGroup`: represents an outer semidirect product arising from a homomorphism,

- `+replab.WreathProductGroup`: describes the wreath product of a compact groups by a permutation group.
